# Microsoft YaHei Mono for Powerline

This fonts is forked from [here](https://github.com/doggy8088/MicrosoftYaHeiMono-CP950). I use [powerline font patcher](https://github.com/powerline/fontpatcher) to add the support for powerline.

With this font, you can use your cmd.exe with beautiful mono fonts without changing the code page from 950 to 65001.
